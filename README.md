# StudyBridge: A Clinical Trials Matching Platform

Small project developed to connect patients with relevant clinical trials. Given a transcript of a patient interview, the platform uses AI to extract key information and match the patient with suitable clinical trials listed on ClinicalTrials.gov.

## Features

- Transcript upload and processing with AI
- Matching algorithm for clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov
- User-friendly interface for research coordinators and patients to find recommendations.

## Approach

1. Understand the problem and requirements.
2. User research with a potential user journey [simulated here](docs/0_user_journey.png)
3. Design the system architecture and choose appropriate technologies. See [architecture brainstorm](docs/2_tech_stack_options.png)
4. Create general project structure and set up the development environment.
5. Implement the core features, including transcript processing and trial matching.
