                    "briefSummary": "Modern footwear has been implicated as a contributor to foot pathology and changes in the biomechanics of gait. In addition to footwear, the investigators propose that the lack of terrain variation may directly contribute to the development of common foot pathologies, resulting from decreased intrinsic foot muscle function. This study will examine the current understanding of terrain variation on foot musculature strength and its possible correlation with structural and functional changes within the foot.",
                    "detailedDescription": "The Human foot is one or the most complicated structures in the conveyance of normal gait, with its 26 bones, 33 articulations, 19 individual intrinsic muscles and direct contribution from all of the lower leg musculature. It also contains a complexity of ligamentous structures that not only act as stabilizers, but also store and release energy in a spring like fashion (Ker 1987). This group of anatomical structures is modulated by a complex system of mechanoreceptors that allow for adaptation to a multitude of varying terrain, while maintaining stability and control. (Franklin 2018) Thus the investigators see the structural, spring and muscular systems all coordinating together to allow for bipedal gait through the natural world.\n\nMultiple observational studies have found an exceptionally low prevalence of common foot pathologies in unshod populations that ambulate on variable terrain daily (Shulman, Choi). At the same time, these same pathologies have become increasingly common in western societies. These findings suggest that something about the western lifestyle is contributing to the development of common foot pathologies. Modern footwear has already been implicated as a contributor to foot pathology and changes in the biomechanics of gait. In a study by K. D'AoÛt et al. on an unshod vs shod Indian population, they found that barefoot walkers had a more equal distribution of peak pressures over the entire load carrying surface than in the habitually shod subjects. The shod subjects had regions of very high or very low peak pressures throughout the load carrying surface.\n\nThe increase prevalence of foot pain in the developed world has long been recognized as a significant risk factor for ambulatory disability, (Hill, C. 2008) with plantar fasciitis and hallux valgus being two of the most common causes of foot discomfort presenting in the clinical setting today. Plantar fasciitis accounts for approximately 13% of all foot symptoms requiring professional medical treatment and is believed to be the result of weakening of the intrinsic foot musculature and chronic overload to the plantar foot supportive structure. (Buchanan, B. 2020). Intrinsic foot muscle function seems to play and import role in the development of foot pathology, and is one of the key factors effecting foot health.\n\nThe lack of terrain variation found in urbanized western society may directly contribute to the development of foot pathologies. Terrain variation in a minimally shod foot should allow for more coordination and strengthening of the muscular and spring like systems within the foot, through the increase and variation of stimuli encountered by its mechanoreceptors. Lack of terrain variation most probably contributes to a decreased intrinsic foot muscle function and response. There have been many studies showing the correlation between improved intrinsic foot musculature strength and the reduction of foot pain and discomfort, but to date, there are no studies that examined the relationship between terrain variation and intrinsic foot muscle function and strength."

                    "briefSummary": "Plantar fasciitis (PF) is a common condition in the population. One of the interventions used to resolve this condition is myofascial release (MR), which consists of massages that help reduce pain and increase mobility. MR has shown efficacy when applied for 30 minutes, however, it is necessary to compare it with a 15-minute MR intervention, since in clinical practice optimizing time is essential. Accordingly, the present research seeks to evaluate whether there are differences in the application time of myofascial release in people with PF.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Plantar fasciitis (PF) is an acute inflammation of the fascia resulting from degenerative irritation from the median tuberosity of the heel bone to surrounding perifascial structures. Histological findings include granulation tissue, microtears, collagen disorders, and in particular a lack of normal inflammation. It is one of the most common causes of musculoskeletal pain, with a population prevalence in adults aged 50 years or older of 9.6% (95% CI: 8.8 to 10.5) and a population prevalence of disabling pain of 7.9% (95% CI: 7.1 to 8.7), slightly more present in women than in men, with a history of knee, hip, and back pain. It is characterized by pain on the first step and pain during weight-bearing tasks, particularly after periods of rest. Among the possible low-cost and noninvasive treatments that have shown efficacy Manual therapy (MT) is a popular treatment for PF. TM includes treatments such as joint and soft tissue mobilizations, manipulations, myofascial trigger point release, and stretch-contraction-relaxation. In particular, myofascial release is a gradual soft tissue stretching by the clinician that is guided entirely by feedback from the recipient's body to determine the direction, strength, and duration of the stretch to address specific soft tissue restrictions.\n\nTM has been frequently used to treat PF, systematic reviews have reported positive results on pain, function, and pressure pain threshold, but suggest that they should be viewed with caution due to poor methodological quality, intervention heterogeneity in dosing (frequency, intensity, and duration), techniques, and outcome measures, and the frequent use of secondary manual therapy co-interventions. The application of myofascial release is varied in the number of procedures, application time of each technique and total application time of the intervention, without a clear justification regarding the decision of each of these options. A clinical trial applied a protocol for 4 weeks, where each session was performed in 30 minutes, and demonstrated that myofascial release is more effective than the control group, presenting a change in the average pressure pain threshold of 1.3 kg/cm2 at the end of the 4-week treatment. This change is considered clinically important, given that in the literature it has been reported that this difference is \\> 1.16 kg/cm2. However, the reason for the time used, the number of techniques and the choice of techniques is not justified. In addition, there are no investigations in the literature on the specific effect of myofascial release with a shorter application time in PF. On the other hand, studies with deep massage, a manual therapy technique, combined with flexibility exercise has proven to be effective with an execution time of 10 minutes. Under this context and considering that in clinical practice the optimization of times is essential, it is relevant to carry out a clinical equivalence trial that allows to determine the efficacy of isolated myofascial release in PF, with a 30-minute intervention protocol already carried out and that demonstrated positive effects on the pressure pain threshold, contrasted with a time of less than 15 minutes. Given the context raised, the question arises: In participants with plantar fasciitis, would the application of a myofascial release treatment for 15 minutes have equivalent effects to myofascial release applied for 30 minutes, in the pain and stiffness of the gastrocnemius muscle?"

                    "briefSummary": "This study is to create a test that can accurately find and measure the problem areas in muscle and fascia tissue, also known as myofascial pain. The hypothesis is that a combination of imaging findings will be able to detect when myofascial pain is present. The goal is to improve management of myofascial pain by making better tools to find changes in the muscle and fascia tissues for a more personalized treatment. This project was funded by the HEAL initiative (https://heal.nih.gov/).",
                    "detailedDescription": "The objective of the R61 phase is to use novel imaging techniques to develop a diagnostic biosignature to objectively and accurately determine the location and severity of abnormal myofascial tissue. A cross-sectional study design approach with 3 groups: plantar fasciitis (n=50), Achilles tendinopathy (n=25), and pain-free controls (n=25) to test Specific Aim: Develop a diagnostic imaging biosignature of myofascial tissue to differentiate individuals with plantar fasciitis from other foot pain without a myofascial component (Achilles tendinopathy) and from matched pain-free controls.\n\nThe goal is to develop a diagnostic imaging biosignature that will be able to distinguish between A-MTrP in individuals with plantar fasciitis compared to healthy tissue control (pain-free controls). The biosignature developed in this R61 phase will be screened for clinical utility and considered of interest for further study if it meets the following milestone criteria: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) \\>0.7, sensitivity \\>60%, and specificity \\>60%. The ROC analysis will estimate diagnostic performance by comparing differences in biosignatures between tissue where myofascial pain is present vs. tissue where pain is absent.\n\nThe proposed sample size of 50 individuals with plantar fasciitis, 25 individuals with Achilles tendinopathy, and 25 matched controls was chosen to provide a confidence interval halfwidth of 0.10 for an AUC of 0.70, assuming 5 muscle measurements for each participant and an overall A-MTrPs prevalence of 0.36 in individuals with plantar fasciitis. Further assuming the 20 biomarkers to be considered in the R61 phase have AUCs uniformly distributed from 0.5 to 0.8, will have at least 85% power to obtain a biosignature meeting the milestone criteria."

                    "detailedDescription": "Background\n\nPlantar fasciitis is the classic and most common type of heel pain. Extrapolating the rate of 2 million or 0.6% of the US American population being treated for plantar fasciitis every year to Switzerland, the corresponding number of patients would amount to 50'000 patients being treated for plantar fasciitis. Considering the costs for health care and the temporary disability not only for work, plantar fasciitis results in a substantial (and at least partially unnecessary) burden for the Swiss health care system and national economics.\n\nNonoperative treatment is the mainstay of treating plantar fasciitis. In the literature, numerous operative and nonoperative treatment approaches for plantar fasciitis have been suggested. However, so far no treatment has proven to be superior to others, and there is national and international lack of consensus of how to treat plantar fasciitis best. Numerous prescriptions for unnecessary orthoses, expensive and painful shock waves, and complications following steroid injection could be obviated, when the safe BTX-A injection demonstrates good results.\n\nThe investigators believe that the BTX-A injection in the gastrocnemius and the soleus muscles is currently the most promising non-operative approach, because it is considered to treat the disease at its origin (temporary weakening of the tight triceps surae muscle) as opposed to simply alleviate the symptoms (e.g. plantar cortisone and other injections, ESWT).\n\nThe high number of level I and II studies suggests that there is need for clarification and evaluation of the efficacy of several non-operative and operative treatment approaches for the chronic plantar fasciitis. However, to date there is no evidence in the literature that compares the new, promising technique of BTX-A injection into the gastroc-soleus complex to a sham (saline) injection and to the gold standard steroid injection at the plantar fascia insertion site. With the intended study, this gap is going to be closed. Objective evaluation of the BTX-A efficacy includes the randomized allocation of patients to the BTX-A, the steroid, or the saline group, the blinded comparison to the sham (saline) injection, and finally the MRI assessment at the beginning and at the end of the followup. With the evidence resulting from this study, patients can be superiorly counseled in the future with regard to efficacy of nonoperative treatment of plantar fasciitis.\n\nObjective\n\nPlantar fasciitis is the classic and most common type of heel pain. Considering the costs for health care and the temporary disability not only for work, plantar fasciitis results in a substantial (and at least partially unnecessary) burden for the Swiss health care system and national economics. However, so far no treatment has proven to be superior to others, and there is national and international lack of consensus of how to treat plantar fasciitis best.\n\nMethods\n\nPatients are randomly allocated to three groups (1 - 3).\n\n\\- Patient group 1 - combination of physiotherapy, stretching exercises according to DiGiovanni et al and BTX-A injection into the gastroc-soleus complex: One hundred units (U) of toxin are applied to each muscle belly, and 1 application of 50 U is administered to the soleus, making a total of 250 U.\n\n* Patient group 2 - physiotherapy, stretching exercises according to DiGiovanni combined with cortisone injection into the plantar fascia\n* Patient group 3 - physiotherapy, stretching exercises according to DiGiovanni and saline injection into the gastroc-soleus complex (sham control group)"

Botulinum toxin type-A has this effect because it prevents the vesicle where the acetylcholine is stored from binding to the membrane where the neurotransmitter can be released. Botulinum toxin type-A thus blocks the release of acetylcholine by the neuron. This will effectively weaken the muscle for a period of three to four months.\n\nIn addition to its cosmetic applications, Botox is currently used in the treatment of spasms and dystonias, by weakening involved muscles, for the 60-70 day effective period of the drug. The main conditions treated with botulinum toxin are: Cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis) (a neuromuscular disorder involving the head and neck), Blepharospasm (excessive blinking) etc..",

                    "detailedDescription": "Plantar fasciitis is a pathology resulting from inflammation and/or degeneration of the plantar fascia of the sole of the foot. It affects about 10% of the population. It is one of the most common causes of chronic heel pain in the community and there is tenderness to palpation on the medial aspect of the heel bone. Patients complain of pain particularly with the first step in the morning and after rest. Mechanical overload and overuse can cause inflammation of the fascia. Diagnosis is usually made by clinical assessment and no further investigations are required.\n\nIn this study, 90 patients between the ages of 18 and 65 who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled and participants will be randomised into 3 groups. The 1st group will be taught ESWT and home exercises for 1 session per week for 3 weeks and will be asked to do it every day. The 2nd group will receive 3 sessions of low intensity LASER per week for 3 weeks and will be asked to do home exercises every day. The 3rd group will only be taught home exercises and asked to do participants every day for 3 weeks. Visual analogue scale, foot function index, plantar fascia thickness measurement with USG and balance parameters will be measured at the beginning of the study, at the end of the treatment and at week 12."

                    "briefSummary": "Plantar fasciitis (PF) is one of the most common causes of heel pain, typically characterized by a sharp pain in the plantar aponeurosis, specifically near the insertion site close to the medial process of the calcaneal tuberosity. It has been reported that 1 in 10 people are expected to be affected by PF in their lifetime. A comprehensive internet-panel survey conducted among the adult United States population revealed the population-based prevalence of self-reported PF with pain in the last month was 0.85 percent. Approximately 1 million patients are diagnosed with this disease each year in the United States. PF was believed to be an acute inflammatory disease, but patient samples show it is actually a chronic degenerative process caused by various factors such as repetitive stresses, vascular and metabolic disorders, excess free radicals, high temperatures, genetic factors, and conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthropathies. PF may be associated with impaired health-related quality of life, including reduced life functioning, poor perceived health status and social isolation. Additionally, a recent study indicates that the annual cost associated with PF is $284 million.\n\nThe first-line treatments recommended by guidelines for PF encompass physical therapy (including manual therapy, stretching, and others), pharmacological therapy (involving corticosteroids or platelet-rich plasma), and surgical treatment. However, the definite effects of physical therapy still require confirmation. Pharmacological treatments, such as local corticosteroid injections, exhibit a short maintenance period. Some studies indicate that the relief provided by corticosteroid injections lasts up to one month, yet its efficacy diminishes after 6 months. Surgical treatment is generally advised 6 to 12 months after unsuccessful conservative treatment, albeit with the drawback of higher costs, post-surgery recovery time, and patient apprehension.\n\nAcupuncture is one of the most common complementary alternative therapy for the treatment of pain-related diseases such as musculoskeletal muscle, and recent guidelines recommend dry needling as a treatment for relief of plantar fasciitis, with a level of evidence of B. Dry acupuncture is different from acupuncture in terms of theoretical basis, therapeutic apparatus, technical operation and scope of indications, however, the American Alliance for Professional Acupuncture Safety also believes that dry needling falls under the umbrella of acupuncture, but under a different name. In addition, there are systematic evaluations that suggest acupuncture can be a safe and effective treatment for PF, and most of the trials in the systematic evaluations used 4-week treatment courses. Our prior study demonstrated that a 4-week intervention of both electroacupuncture and manual acupuncture resulted in improved pain outcomes among patients with PF.\n\nThe frequency of acupuncture stands as a crucial factor influencing its efficacy. A study revealed that needling trials with negative results had a significantly lower frequency compared to those yielding positive results. Furthermore, several studies indicate that acupuncture once a week can be help in conditions such as simple obesity, functional dyspepsia, and overactive bladder in women. There is no universally accepted standard of frequency of treatment for many conditions, including PF. In China, patients with chronic diseases usually receive 3-5 acupuncture treatments per week. However, in most previous trials, individuals with chronic diseases received 1-2 needling sessions per week. An increase in the frequency of acupuncture means an increase in the pain, time, and financial investment associated with the acupuncture process. Therefore, it is critical to optimize the frequency of acupuncture to ensure the effectiveness and feasibility of the treatment while avoiding increasing the burden on the patient. Accordingly, the investigators designed the current trial to compare the effects of different acupuncture sessions (1 session per week versus 3 sessions per week) in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of chronic PF. The hypothesis is that 1 session per week compared with 3 sessions per week of electroacupuncture treatment over a total of 4 weeks of treatment will provide a similar effect on pain relief in chronic PF."
