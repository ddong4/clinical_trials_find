"""
Clinical Trials Client Package

This package contains the auto-generated OpenAPI client for ClinicalTrials.gov API.
It's kept separate from the main application and accessed through the clinical_trials service.

Note: This is generated code and should not be modified directly.
Use the app.services.clinical_trials module for a clean interface.

# This package contains generated code and is accessed via the service layer
